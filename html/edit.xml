                <p id="p-1">Texture is a WYSIWYG editor app that allows users to turn raw content into structured
                    content, and add as much semantic information as needed for the production of scientific
                    publications. Texture is open source software built on top of Substance (http://substance.io), an
                    advanced Javascript content authoring library. While the Substance library is format agnostic, the
                    Texture editor uses JATS XML as a native exchange format. The Substance library that Texture is
                    built on already supports real-time collaborative authoring, and the easy-to-use WYSIWYG interface
                    would make Texture an attractive alternative to Google Docs. For some editors, the interface could
                    be toggled to more closely resemble a professional XML suite, allowing a user to pop out a raw
                    attribute editor for any given element. Texture-authored documents could then be brought into the
                    journal management system directly, skipping the conversion step, and move straight into a
                    document-centric publishing workflow.

            <p id="p-2"><italic id="italic-1">Microsoft Word</italic>'s dominance as an authoring tool creates
                substantial inefficiencies in the scholarly authoring ecosystem. Many journals and journal management
                platforms are designed around uploading and downloading incrementally updated drafts of Word
                manuscripts, creating a difficult-to-manage ecosystem of individual change-tracked files and annotated
                PDFs. For most end users, there is no sufficiently easy to use or widely accepted alternative to this;
                although some researchers author in LaTeX or Markdown which can at least be <italic id="italic-2">
                    diff</italic>ed line by line, getting most authors away from Word has been a fairly fruitless task
                so far. We believe that this is mostly due to ease of use. Yet, when it comes to publishing, the
                scholarly publishing industry has (mostly) settled on a structured format—JATS XML. This disconnect
                between the tools and formats used for authoring and the formats required for publishing has meant that,
                for several decades now, manuscripts received from authors will need to be entirely XML-typeset by
                publishers at considerable expense (<xref id="IDad51a777-cce8-4561-9608-aa93daf279d1" rid="R1"

            </p>
            <p id="p-3">The role of the XML typesetting is so crucial that there are several companies that specialize
                in just this task. Right now, most academic journals with adequate budgets have outstanding contracts
                with third-party typesetting shops, resulting in a process that is highly professionalized, but also
                highly impractical and unavailable to many smaller journals. This work, requiring specialized labour and
                more person-hours than can be easily justified, has been one of the main differentiating factors between
                well-resourced journals and those on shoestring budgets. This is especially unfortunate, as having an
                XML-first workflow that allows journals to produce multiple formats from a single source would be
                especially beneficial to such low-budget journals.

            <p id="p-4">Efforts to bring XML markup, in particular JATS, to a broader group of journals have continued
                to appear in recent years. These efforts, in the form of automatic Word-to-XML converters include the
                Public Knowledge Project’s Open Typsetting Stack (<xref id="ID4a404789-267a-463a-858b-cb40a9332576"

                none of these tools, and, to the best of our knowledge, none of the proprietary tools used by those
                offering professional XML markup services, produce production-quality JATS without user mediation, and
                still require manual or semi-manual intervention. From the perspective of publishers who are currently
                not producing JATS, this last step requires having XML expertise on hand, or the resources to acquire
                them.

                    different steps are taken to turn the article into a structured, semantically tagged article,
                    augmented with metadata. For example, the author of a document could be represented as plaintext

                        author</italic>. On the next level, this can be replaced by a structured version, with &lt;family-name&gt;,
                    &lt;given-name&gt;, etc, and even more metadata such as an ORCID, for instance. The same would be
                    true for citations. Similarly, references can be initially tagged as <italic id="italic-4">mixed
                        citations,</italic>but at a later stage, Texture can connect to third party APIs (e.g. DataCite,
                    CrossRef) and convert them into fully structured element citations.

                    <p id="p-11">With Texture, editors can use an interface similar to a classic word processor. This
                        makes the difficult job of manually crafting XML (such as in the <italic id="italic-6">Oxygen
                        </italic> software) unnecessary for most workflows and provides a more natural approach to
                        content curation. The user interface can be extended to reflect specialized viewing modes;
                        Texture can be customized for different user roles to provide different levels of complexity.
                        For some editors, the interface could be toggled to more closely resemble a professional XML

                        contrast, Open Journal Systems (OJS) will integrate Texture into their web-based journal
                        management software, where documents are read from and saved to a database.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-13">Texture is different from other web editors as it maintains a local state of the
                        complete document in memory. This means the editor is always responsive and does not require a
                        permanent internet connection while editing. This design allows for both offline editing and
                        real time collaboration, where each collaborator maintains a local copy and only synchronizes
                        changes with the other peers. If content is enhanced through online-services (e.g. DataCite,
                        CrossRef) Texture stores a snapshot of the current data and a URI to the canonical resource so
                        it can be automatically refreshed. Per the JATS standard, documents are fully self-contained.
                        Complex XML stores and versioning are generally not in the scope of Texture, but users can
                        provide their own backends. The editor can always be asked for a snapshot of the current JATS
                        serialisation, or a listener can be registered to be called on each change, allowing for storing
                        the complete editing history, on keystroke level if needed.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-14">Unlike other HTML/XML editors, Texture keeps annotations separate from the text
                        internally. A reference to the text element being annotated is stored along with the character
                        offset (start, end) of the annotation (e.g. bold). Using this flat model, Texture can
                        effectively handle overlapping of annotations, without ending up with very deep nesting or lots
                        of fragments in the resulting XML.
                    </p>
                    <p id="p-15">Texture provides lossless conversion in that it recreates the schema of JATS in-memory,
                        by utilising the XML schema. Most elements from the &lt;body&gt; and &lt;article-meta&gt; will
                        then be editable out of the box. Some JATS elements, such as the &lt;contrib&gt; element, allow
                        many different ways of tagging, which would require many different user interfaces for each
                        tagging scenario. With Texture, we want to work towards flexible tagging conventions that can
                        power the best possible user interfaces. Users of Texture (the consortium members) are defining
                        those conventions collaboratively. According to agreed conventions Texture can then normalise
                        certain elements providing extremely consistent tagging, which would be hard to achieve in a
                        manual typesetting scenario.

                            stage. Instead of providing Texture at the end of the editorial process, Texture could <bold
                                    id="bold-4">be used within the review or editing workflows</bold>. The automated
                            conversion could be performed on the author’s original manuscript, allowing the JATS XML,
                            with Texture as a front-end, to be exclusively used for the review, copyediting, and proofs.
                            While many journals and journal management platforms are designed around the uploading and
                            downloading incrementally updated drafts of Microsoft Word manuscripts, there is an emerging
                            trend toward document centric workflows (e.g., the Collaborative Knowledge Foundation
                            platforms, eLife’s Continuum, and PLOS’ Aperta) which use an HTML-rendered version of the
                            manuscript for authors, reviewers, and journal staff to interact with. Texture could provide
                            this HTML rendition (as a Web editor, it provides an HTML rendition of the underlying JATS
                            XML). This approach works well with Texture's iterative improvement philosophy; at each
                            stage in the workflow, authors and journal staff interact with the document and have the
                            opportunity to improve the document towards its publication-ready final form.

                        <p id="p-18">Finally, yet another iteration of Texture could <bold id="bold-5">be used by
                            authors</bold>even earlier in the process. In this case, instead of serving as an editor,
                            Texture would be a from-scratch authoring tool, allowing authors to create production-ready
                            XML documents from the beginning. The Substance library that Texture is built on already
                            supports real-time collaborative authoring, and the easy-to-use WYSIWYG interface would make
                            Texture an attractive alternative to Google Docs. Texture-authored documents could then be
                            brought into the journal management system directly, skipping the conversion step, and move
                            straight into a document-centric publishing workflow.

                                We currently have an alpha plugin for integrating OTS into our Open Journal Systems
                                publishing platform; this plugin includes Texture. Our solution, using the Open
                                Typesetting Stack and Texture, aims to address the impracticalities of trying to
                                "reverse-engineer" an author's work in Word while still supporting a polished,
                                professional typesetting workflow.

                            <p id="p-20">The Open Typesetting Stack provides a toolchain for automatically converting
                                Word or PDF documents to National Library of Medicine JATS XML. More than a dozen open
                                source libraries are used to produce this result; parsing accuracy is better than any
                                other known tool, at around 80% averaged across all document elements on a real-world
                                corpus, but still generally not good enough for production-quality output by itself.
                                Improving our automated parsing quality beyond 80% has, expectedly, slowed due to the
                                many different ways to non-syntactically format a Word or PDF article, necessitating a
                                supervised solution to finish the job. Unfortunately, because many publisher workflows
                                are fairly idiosyncratic, it is not necessarily helpful to hand off this 80% accurate
                                result to a typesetter on the assumption that they have specialized XML editing software
                                to finish the job. Thus closing this 80% gap is still an issue.

                                and editors have the option to hand off any uploaded Word or PDF documents to OTS,

                                workflow. As OTS' JATS output is generally not good enough to go directly to
                                publication, users of OJS have the ability to continue editing directly in a Texture

                                process, so that carrying forward changes to the eventual layout draft entails minimal

                                    editors, reviewers, and late-stage collaborators should drive uptake, as will
                                    integration into journal publishing platforms such as Open Journal Systems. While in
                                    the short term Texture will focus on publishers' use-cases, we are exploring future
                                    use cases for Texture as an authoring interface. For example, peer-review could be
                                    realized entirely in Texture, including communication between peers (reviewers,
                                    authors, editors) which currently is fragmented over different channels such as
                                    Email or Messengers.
